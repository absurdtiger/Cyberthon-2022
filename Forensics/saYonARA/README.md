Description
---
Jessie and James were identified to be members of the APOCALYPSE.

They have devised a secret form of communication, sending each other messages by first encrypting it with a monoalphabetic rotation cipher, followed by Base64 encoding, and embedding the final ciphertext into an executable file.

This file is then hidden within a directory of files. Using YARA, help us uncover their encoded message and crack the cipher!
