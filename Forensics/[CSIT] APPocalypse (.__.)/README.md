# [CSIT] APPocalypse (.__.)
- 400 points
- we did not solve this during the ctf

Description
---
We have managed to extract an APP from one of the APOCALYPSE member's iPhone. We need your help in analysing the APP and see if there are any secrets hidden within.

Seems like there is a passcode required to unlock something. What could it be?

Use the file in the challenge "APPocalypse (SOS)"
