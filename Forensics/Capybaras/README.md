Someone in APOCALYPSE really seems to like capybaras. There's a rumor going around that they're illegally distributing flags in zip files, but we've obtained one such zip file and there's only an image of a capybara inside.

I have confidence that our intel is correct, so could you help me take a closer look at the zip file?
