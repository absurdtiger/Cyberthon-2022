# Really Big But Sparse
- 1000 points
- not solved during ctf

APOCALYPSE wants to overwhelm our deep content inspection with their massive files, we have reason to believe that some secret information is being encoded inside.

Our spies have confirmed that a variant of writefile.py was used to generate reallybig. Then that 1TB file was compressed into reallybig.tar.xz for distribution to you.

Please be careful when decompressing it! You do not have to decompress fully to 1TB to solve this challenge.
